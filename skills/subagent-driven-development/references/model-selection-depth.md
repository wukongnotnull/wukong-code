# Model Selection Depth

Extended guidance for SDD model choice. Resident skill keeps the role bullets.

**Turn count beats token price.** Wall-clock and context cost scale with how
many turns a subagent takes, and the cheapest models routinely take 2-3× the
turns on multi-step work — costing more overall. Use a mid-tier model as the
floor for reviewers and for implementers working from prose descriptions.
When the task's plan text contains the complete code to write, the
implementation is transcription plus testing: use the cheapest tier for
that implementer. Single-file mechanical fixes also take the cheapest tier.

**Task complexity signals (implementation tasks):**
- Touches 1-2 files with a complete spec → cheap model
- Touches multiple files with integration concerns → standard model
- Requires design judgment or broad codebase understanding → most capable model
