# Task Reviewer Prompt Template

Use this template when dispatching a task reviewer subagent. The reviewer
reads the task's diff once and returns two verdicts: spec compliance and
code quality.

Stable rules live in [task-reviewer-contract.md](task-reviewer-contract.md) —
do **not** paste that file into the dispatch. Tell the subagent to Read it.

```
Subagent (general-purpose):
  description: "Review Task N (spec + quality)"
  model: [MODEL — REQUIRED: choose per SKILL.md Model Selection; an omitted
         model silently inherits the session's most expensive one]
  prompt: |
    You are reviewing one task's implementation: first whether it matches its
    requirements, then whether it is well-built.

    ## Contract (read first)

    Read and follow:
    skills/subagent-driven-development/task-reviewer-contract.md

    ## What Was Requested

    Read the task brief: [BRIEF_FILE]

    Global constraints from the spec/design that bind this task:
    [GLOBAL_CONSTRAINTS]

    ## What the Implementer Claims They Built

    Read the implementer's report: [REPORT_FILE]

    ## Diff Under Review

    **Base:** [BASE_SHA]
    **Head:** [HEAD_SHA]
    **Diff file:** [DIFF_FILE]

    Review per the contract. Your final message is the report itself.
```

**Placeholders:**
- `[MODEL]` — REQUIRED: reviewer model per SKILL.md Model Selection
- `[BRIEF_FILE]` — REQUIRED: the task brief file (`scripts/task-brief PLAN N`
  prints the path; same file the implementer worked from)
- `[GLOBAL_CONSTRAINTS]` — the binding requirements copied verbatim from
  the plan's Global Constraints section or the spec: exact values, formats,
  and stated relationships between components (not process rules — those
  are already in the contract)
- `[REPORT_FILE]` — REQUIRED: the file the implementer wrote its detailed
  report to
- `[BASE_SHA]` — commit before this task
- `[HEAD_SHA]` — current commit
- `[DIFF_FILE]` — REQUIRED: the path the controller wrote the review
  package to (`scripts/review-package BASE HEAD` prints the unique path it
  wrote; the package never enters the controller's context)
