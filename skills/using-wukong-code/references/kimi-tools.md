Kimi Code tool mapping for Wukong Code skills:

- When a Wukong Code skill says to ask the user, ask clarifying questions, ask one question at a time, present multiple-choice options, use the terminal for a question, or wait for the user's choice, call Kimi Code's `AskUserQuestion` tool. Do not render those choices as plain assistant text unless `AskUserQuestion` is unavailable or the session is in auto permission mode.
- For `AskUserQuestion`, provide 1 question with 2-4 concrete options when possible. Put the recommended option first and suffix its label with `(Recommended)`.
- When a Wukong Code skill refers to `TodoWrite`, use Kimi Code's `TodoList` tool.
- When a Wukong Code skill says `Task tool (general-purpose)` or asks you to dispatch an implementer/reviewer subagent, use Kimi Code's `Agent` tool with a Kimi subagent type. Do not pass `general-purpose` as `subagent_type`.
- For implementation, code review, spec review, quality review, and filled Wukong Code subagent prompt templates, call `Agent` with `subagent_type: "coder"`, paste the fully filled prompt into `prompt`, and provide a short `description`.
- For read-only codebase exploration that would take several searches, use `Agent` with `subagent_type: "explore"`.
- For read-only planning or architecture design, use `Agent` with `subagent_type: "plan"`.
- Keep dependent Wukong Code subagent steps sequential. Use multiple `Agent` calls, or `run_in_background: true` only when the work is independent and background agents are available.
- When a Wukong Code skill refers to the `Skill` tool, use Kimi Code's native `Skill` tool.
- Use Kimi Code's `Read`, `Write`, `Edit`, `Bash`, `Grep`, `Glob`, `FetchURL`, `WebSearch`, and MCP tools by their actual exposed names.
- When a skill asks to search file contents, use `Grep`; when it asks to find files by path or pattern, use `Glob`; when it asks to fetch a URL, use `FetchURL`; when it asks to search the web, use `WebSearch`.
