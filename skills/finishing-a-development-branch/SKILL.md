# Finishing a Development Branch

## Overview

Guide completion of development work by presenting clear options and handling chosen workflow.

**Core principle:** Verify tests → Detect environment → Present options → Execute choice → Clean up.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the finishing-a-development-branch skill to complete this work."

## The Process

### Step 1: Verify Tests

**Before presenting options, verify tests pass:**

```bash
# Run project's test suite
npm test / cargo test / pytest / go test ./...
```

**If tests fail:**
```
Tests failing (<N> failures). Must fix before completing:

[Show failures]

Cannot proceed with merge/PR until tests pass.
```

Stop. Don't proceed to Step 2.

**If tests pass:** Continue to Step 2.

### Step 2: Detect Environment

**Determine workspace state before presenting options:**

```bash
GIT_DIR=$(cd "$(git rev-parse --git-dir)" 2>/dev/null && pwd -P)
GIT_COMMON=$(cd "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)" 2>/dev/null && pwd -P)
```

This determines which menu to show and how cleanup works:

| State | Menu | Cleanup |
|-------|------|---------|
| `GIT_DIR == GIT_COMMON` (normal repo) | Standard 4 options | No worktree to clean up |
| `GIT_DIR != GIT_COMMON`, named branch | Standard 4 options | Provenance-based (see finish-options) |
| `GIT_DIR != GIT_COMMON`, detached HEAD | Reduced 3 options (no merge) | No cleanup (externally managed) |

### Step 3: Determine Base Branch

```bash
# Try common base branches
git merge-base HEAD main 2>/dev/null || git merge-base HEAD master 2>/dev/null
```

Or ask: "This branch split from main - is that correct?"

### Step 4: Present Options

**Normal repo and named-branch worktree — present exactly these 4 options:**

```
Implementation complete. What would you like to do?

1. Merge back to <base-branch> locally
2. Push and create a Pull Request
3. Keep the branch as-is (I'll handle it later)
4. Discard this work

Which option?
```

**Detached HEAD — present exactly these 3 options:**

```
Implementation complete. You're on a detached HEAD (externally managed workspace).

1. Push as new branch and create a Pull Request
2. Keep as-is (I'll handle it later)
3. Discard this work

Which option?
```

**Don't add explanation** - keep options concise.

### Step 5: Execute Choice

After the user picks an option, Read `skills/finishing-a-development-branch/references/finish-options.md` for per-option commands, confirmation prompts, and workspace cleanup (Options 1 and 4 only).

## Common Mistakes

**Skipping test verification**
- **Problem:** Merge broken code, create failing PR
- **Fix:** Always verify tests before offering options

**Open-ended questions**
- **Problem:** "What should I do next?" is ambiguous
- **Fix:** Present exactly 4 structured options (or 3 for detached HEAD)

**Cleaning up worktree for Option 2**
- **Problem:** Remove worktree user needs for PR iteration
- **Fix:** Only cleanup for Options 1 and 4

**Deleting branch before removing worktree**
- **Problem:** `git branch -d` fails because worktree still references the branch
- **Fix:** Merge first, remove worktree, then delete branch

**Running git worktree remove from inside the worktree**
- **Problem:** Command fails silently when CWD is inside the worktree being removed
- **Fix:** Always `cd` to main repo root before `git worktree remove`

**Cleaning up harness-owned worktrees**
- **Problem:** Removing a worktree the harness created causes phantom state
- **Fix:** Only clean up worktrees under `.worktrees/` or `worktrees/`

**No confirmation for discard**
- **Problem:** Accidentally delete work
- **Fix:** Require typed "discard" confirmation

## Red Flags

**Never:**
- Proceed with failing tests
- Merge without verifying tests on result
- Delete work without confirmation
- Force-push without explicit request
- Remove a worktree before confirming merge success
- Clean up worktrees you didn't create (provenance check)
- Run `git worktree remove` from inside the worktree

**Always:**
- Verify tests before offering options
- Detect environment before presenting menu
- Present exactly 4 options (or 3 for detached HEAD)
- Get typed confirmation for Option 4
- Clean up worktree for Options 1 & 4 only
- `cd` to main repo root before worktree removal
- Run `git worktree prune` after removal
